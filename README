Installer script and helper stuff for an automatic installation of
LibraryBox on OpenWRT (with special custom image).

Makefile	-  OpenWRT Makefile for box-installer package creation


syslog_recv.py  -  simply python script for client computer,
		   collecting installation log information.
		   Client has to be connected via wired and fixed 
		   	IP  192.168.1.2

files/bin/box_installer.sh - Script doing the work , loggs to STDOUT and STDERR
files/bin/box_installer_start.sh   - Script launching syslog daemon and reroutes installer output to syslog-daeming.
files/bin/box_init_setup.sh  - Script for a simple user menu setting time & password

Requirements on the firmware:
-----------------------------

Package "extendRoot" installed (not initialized)
Package "box-Installer" 

Further Requirments.
--------------------
On the USB Stick has to be located:

<USB Stick>/installer		- Contains
		/auto_package	- One lined file with the packages needed to be installed after bootup
		/OpenWRT.img.gz - (prepared) ext3-image file
		/<packageimg>	- Stuff that needed by 'box packge 
		 /cache		- folder containing all needed .ipk files
		        /Package.gz_attitude_adjustment  - Package-List from public repository
		   	/Package.gz_piratebox	- Package-List from PirateBox repository (optional)


What happens
-------------
During bootup, the box_installer_start.sh initiates the startup of the USB initialization, if extendRoot is not enabled at boot-time.
After extendRoot gets init, the script polls until a USB stick gets available.
On the further progress, it lookups on the install-folder for auto_package and installs that package(s) listed at the first line.
After everthing is done (valid or not), auto_package is renamed into auto_package_done (to prevent infinitive tries).

On a later start of the script, extendRoot does not get initialized anymore, so that would enable you to install additional packages later (maybe....).
